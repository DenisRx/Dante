# Dante's Star!

Dante's Star is an Epitech first year project and is divided in two parts:
- Generator
- Solver

Project success: 85/100

---

### Generator
The generator takes 2 parameters defining the size of the square and an optional one "perfect" (with only 1 valid path). It generates a maze with multiple solutions by default and prints the result.
> ./generator/generator x y [perfect]

### Solver
The solver program takes 1 parameter: the file containing the maze to solve. It tries to find the solution horizontally from the top left corner to the bot right. If no solution is found, the program prints "no solution found" and returns 0.
> ./solver/solver file
